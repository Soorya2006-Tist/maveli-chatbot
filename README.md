The file maveli.py is basically a chatbot using python language (only).
The platform used for coding was Visual Studio Code.

For using Python in VS Code, we have to download some necessary extensions.

The extensions are given below:

**(1) PYTHON EXTENSION  v2024.14.1**

A Visual Studio Code extension with rich support for the Python language (for all actively supported Python versions), providing access points for extensions to seamlessly integrate and offer support for IntelliSense (Pylance), debugging (Python Debugger), formatting, linting, code navigation, refactoring, variable explorer, test explorer, and more!

**(2) PYLANCE EXTENSION v2024.9.2**

Pylance is an extension that works alongside Python in Visual Studio Code to provide performant language support. Pylance is the default language support for Python in Visual Studio Code and is shipped as part of that extension as an optional dependency.

**(3) PYTHON DEBUGGER EXTENSION v2024.10.0**

A Visual Studio Code extension that supports Python debugging with debugpy. Python Debugger provides a seamless debugging experience by allowing you to set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, and perform other essential debugging tasks. The debugpy extension offers debugging support for various types of Python applications including scripts, web applications, remote processes, and multi-threaded processes.

**These are the extensions that was used in VS Code for creating the file.**
